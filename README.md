Analysis of Supermarket Data

I created this as a convenient way for me to reference similar types of analytical python concepts. It illustrates the power of Pandas.
As of now, I don't have any commercial plans for it but you know how it goes sometimes, as things progress.

You can think of this as a reference project, reallly. Nothing special but helpful to guide you as to what analysis is available for say, retail stores sales, etc.
